# Math Expression Evaluator Coding Exercise  

### Running the program
This implementation of the exercise requirements was written with Python 3.7 in mind.
To run the program, `cd` into the working directory and run `calculate.py`, passing in your math expression as an input string. For example: `./calculate.py "124 + 7 - 3 * 79 - 3"`. Be sure to either escape any spaces in the input argument or wrap the whole thing in quotes.  

### Testing
The tests are located in test_calculate.py. They are meant to be used with pytest. If pytest is installed for Python 3.7, the tests can be run by executing `python3.7 -m pytest` in the command line.
